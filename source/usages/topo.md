# Generate a surface topography file

SurfATT requires a surface topography file in the format of `netcdf` with the same format as the file generated by the **GMT** software. Thus, the surface topography file can be generated by the `gmt grdcut` the following command:

```{code-block}
gmt grdcut @earth_relief_01m -R80/90/20/30 -Gtopo.nc
```

The above command generates a surface topography file `topo.nc` with the region `-R80/90/20/30` from the `earth_relief_01m` dataset. The `earth_relief_01m` dataset can be downloaded from the **GMT** website [here](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/datasets/remote-data.html).

SurfATT is an innovative package enhanced by contemporary Fortran with an embedded MPI parallel framework. It employs a user-friendly format for both input/output file types, including:

- `yaml` for parameter files
- `csv` for input/output data files
- `hdf5` for input/output model files

Furthermore, this package provides optimal cross-platform compatibility; it operates perfectly on both personal computers and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems.
